## JavaScript Function Notes

- Script ==> reference to jS that can be excuted
- Programmatic problem solving ==> an approch, schedule or plan, step by step process
- Expression ==> any code that is evaluated and resolves to a value
- Operator
    - `=` assignment operator
    - `||` logical or
    - `&&` logical and
    - `===` strict equals
    - `==` comparative equals
- Function
   - Declaration - when a fuction is DEFINED
   - Call - when you use teh funtion `()` when you execute function or INVOKE the fuction 
   - Parameters - passed in when you DECLARE fuction - general
   -  Arguments - passed in when CALL fuction - specific
   -  Return value - is it a thing ? with js
- Refactoring - "cleaning" or change to suit another purpose,
better practices, more efficient

#### operators

### JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
