## How Computers Work
#### Objectives:
In the video that we're going to watch, we will learn about :
  - what makes a computer a computer
  - How imformation is represented in the computer using Electricity
  - How computer use circuts
  - The 4 parts of the computer
  - software controls hardware

  ### what makes a computer a computer
  Human have always build somthing in help them for the techncal and phisic way but
 nothing for the thinking work such as storing information (calculations or counting the numbers of starts in the space...)
 that's how omputers came to play a big role in the humain live and now were are using them 
 for multiple other reason. 
 there are 4 common things that all computers has (which is what actually a computer a computer):
 - input - this is what you  put in the cmputer (you comande the computer to do)
 - storage - is the memor of a computer(where your input are going to)
 - processing - literally what is name is...(processing the information that came form you and were storaged)
 - output - is what you see in the screen

 ### How imformation is represented in the computer using Electricity
  the information in the computer is represented using "1" and "0"
  scince the Electricity works with "on" and "off" so the computer represet that 
  with "1" and "0" ; "yes" and "no" , "true" or "faulse" or anything else with only two 
  options. this on and off represent a 'Bit'

  ### How computer use circuts
 'circuts' is are milion of tiny electrical component which come together.
 but how can this circuts trasform electricity with ones and zeros?
 those small thing takes electrical signal and transforme them to thier oppoit
 (that is for the incredible simple circut)

But in an other casre (such as more complicated circut) if the signal that comes from the electrity are "0" and "1"
the circut will only give you a "0" and will only give you a "1" if the sgnal that comes form 
the electricity is "1" and "1" so we call this circut "AND". There are manay other type of circuts. and with all of them 
you can have a very fast computer. (remenber the smaller the cercut is,the faster the electricity go and so the information)

###  The 4 parts of the computer
we learn earlier about the 4 part of the computer (it's the samw here)

### software controls hardware
 the software is all the computer programing , the lines of codes runing on a machin. 
 software can be anything from apps and game to web pages and datat science
  but how do the hardware and the software communicate with one an other?

for that, we will look at the CPU (Central Processing Unit):
the CPU is the master tchip that control all the others part of s computer. 
in fact, the CPU commad do the transformation from binary to image, song or anythink else that we see from the computer
