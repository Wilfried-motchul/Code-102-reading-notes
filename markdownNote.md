## Markdown Note
Markdown is a lightweight markup language which helps to make sentences stand out. 
In MLO you can style your task notes adding headings, lists, bold, italic, links, images
and other elements just by typing a few characters before and after your desired text.
Here are some exemple of a mackdown note:
* Heading 1	"#"
* Bold	"This is some **bold text**"
* Inline code	This is `someJavaScript()`
