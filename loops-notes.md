# Loops Notes

- loop
- while true - loop over code
- for - for a certain number of times
- iterate - each time it loops
- condition - think of conditional statment. 
- increment - inrease (possibly by 1)
- decrement - decrease (possibly by 1)
- `i++` shorthand meaning i = i + 1 or i += 1


#### for loop:
```
for (var i = 0; i < 10 ; i++ ){
    console.log(i);
}
```

### while loop:
```
while( true){
    // you will do the thing
}
```


JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
The For Loop
The for loop has the following syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
